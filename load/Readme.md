Usage
---
You should create the `.h5` dataset file by [here](https://github.com/SunnerLi/Ear-Pen/wiki/Readme2.md)    
Next, you should move the all program in this folder to your work folder. The files you should move include `ear_pen.py`, `utils.py` and the dataset file `ear_pen.h5`. The containing in `generate` folder are useless in real program situation. The folder tree will be like this:    
```
--+
  |
  +-- ear_pen.py
  |
  +-- utils.py
  |
  +-- ear_pen.h5
  |
  +-- your_program.py
  |
  ...
```
The simple usage of API is shown in `main.py`.
